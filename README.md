# Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular card game. The player has to compete against a bot.

* Your aim is to get a score of 21 or a higher value than the dealer.
* If your score exceeds 21 then you lose. This is called ‘bust.’
* If your score ties with the dealer then it's a draw. This is called a ‘push.’
* Ace is worth 1 or 11 (pending on which value most benefits you).
* Ten, jack, queen, and king are worth 10.
* Two - nine have their face values.
* You hit if you wish to be dealt more cards.
* You stand if you are happy with your cards.
* (Tip) If your cards total no more than 8 then you should always ‘hit.’
* There’s no guaranteed strategy for winning at blackjack. This is because it’s a game that combines both skill and luck.
